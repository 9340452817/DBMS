\section{TEMPORAL DATABASE MODELING}

Current concept of temporal model is based on an extension of time table attributes that define the validity period. Thus,
the primary key contains not only the identifier, but also information about the period during which the record has a
given characteristic. However, do not to forget the fact that the completed primary key is referenced as a foreign key.
It can cause problems with the time period updating (fig. 2).
Moreover, object attributes defining the validity do not need to affect relationships and thus referencing the time attribute
cannot be necessary (even useless)
