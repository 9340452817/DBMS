\section{IMPORTANCE OF ENDLESS VALUES}
The strong time element is based on the necessity of defining unfinished temporal validity. In the literature, this values
is referred using the notation 9999 or its modifications based on the granularity of the data, represents the latest date
that can be used in current database systems.
This is also one of the reasons, why not to use the NULL values. On one hand, this value does not reflect the future
and, secondly, we cannot use the power of the functions for comparing time. Simply, NULL value should be used for
unknown data, whereas this information is partially known. So the implementation is a real data.
